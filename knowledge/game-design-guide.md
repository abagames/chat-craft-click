# One-Button Game Design Guide

## 1. Core Concepts of One-Button Games

### 1.1 Advantages
- **Accessibility**: Anyone can play regardless of gaming experience
- **Intuitive Controls**: Almost no explanation needed to start playing
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works on any device with a touch screen or button
- **Focus on Mastery**: Deep engagement through a single, refined interaction

### 1.2 Design Challenges
- Creating varied gameplay with minimal input
- Preventing monotonous button mashing
- Providing clear feedback for player actions
- Designing an appropriate difficulty curve

## 2. Recommended Game Design Principles

### 2.1 Novel yet Intuitive Game Concepts
- Create unique game rules that surprise players while remaining immediately understandable
- Design distinctive game environments that provide fresh contexts for familiar mechanics
- Implement creative one-button actions that feel both innovative and natural
- Balance novelty with learnability—new concepts should click quickly with players
- Ensure player actions have logical and satisfying consequences in the game world

### 2.2 Clear Game Over Conditions
- Implement immediately obvious game over conditions such as:
  - Direct collisions with obstacles or enemies
  - Falling off the visible play area
  - Contact with clearly visible hazards
- Use simple, singular game over conditions when possible
- Ensure failure states provide clear visual feedback

### 2.3 Simple Shapes and Visuals
- Employ basic geometric shapes (circles, rectangles, triangles) for game objects
- Keep visual elements minimal and distinct from one another
- Use color purposefully to communicate game states and interactions
- Maintain a simple background that doesn't reduce visibility of foreground elements
- Let the mechanics, not the graphics, create the game's complexity

### 2.4 Avoiding Unnecessary Complexity
- Focus on refining a single core mechanic rather than adding multiple systems
- Avoid complex level designs such as intricate mazes
- Eliminate resource management systems that require tracking multiple variables
- Minimize UI elements, gauges, and text explanations
- Skip tutorials by making mechanics self-explanatory through play

### 2.5 Implicit Visual Feedback
- Communicate game state through visual changes in game objects rather than text
- Use animation, size changes, and color shifts to indicate success or danger
- Design intuitive visual cues that don't require explanation
- Create consistent visual language throughout the game
- Make cause and effect relationships visually obvious

### 2.6 Action-based Scoring
- Award points for deliberate player actions and achievements
- Tie scoring directly to skill-based mechanics
- Create clear risk-reward relationships for point accumulation
- Make high scores achievable through mastery rather than grinding
- Ensure scoring mechanics reinforce the core gameplay loop

## 3. One-Button Interaction Patterns

One-button games utilize three main interaction types: press, hold, and release. Each creates distinct gameplay possibilities.

| Interaction | Mechanic | Example Applications |
|-------------|----------|---------------------|
| **Press** | Direction Change | Change character direction by 90° or 180° in maze games |
| | Jump/Flap | Make character rise against gravity in platformers |
| | Fire Shot | Release projectiles in shooting games |
| | Teleport | Move instantly to preset locations |
| | Split/Divide | Character or projectile divides for area coverage |
| | Toggle Attribute | Switch magnetic polarity, color states, etc. |
| **Hold** | Angle/Power Adjustment | Change trajectory angle or power in golf/shooting games |
| | Stretch/Extend | Extend character or tools to reach distant objects |
| | Defense/Shield | Create temporary invincibility or barrier |
| | Energy Charge | Build up power for stronger actions |
| | Area Effect | Clear multiple elements at once from screen |
| **Release** | Launch | Fire projectile with energy accumulated during hold |
| | Recoil | Bounce back based on hold duration |
| | State Cancellation | End special states with accompanying effects |

## 4. Environmental Interactions & Movement Patterns

### 4.1 Terrain Interactions

| Element | Effect | Gameplay Impact |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Irregular Ground | Changes jump trajectory | Unpredictable movement patterns |
| Floating Platforms | Requires precise timing | Tests player timing skills |
| Environmental Zones | Changes button behavior | Contextual control shifts |
| Gaps/Holes | Creates fall hazards | Risk/reward decisions |
| Moving Obstacles | Requires timed avoidance | Creates tension and urgency |

### 4.2 Movement Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Application |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Automatic Movement** | Character moves constantly | Player focuses only on timing actions |
| **Rotational Movement** | Objects rotate around fixed points | Timing becomes critical for success |
| **Oscillating Movement** | Regular back-and-forth motion | Creates predictable but challenging patterns |
| **Acceleration-Based** | Speed increases over time | Progressively increases difficulty |
| **Physics-Based** | Realistic momentum and inertia | Adds depth to movement mechanics |

## 5. Idea Generation Methods

### 5.1 Adapting Existing Concepts
- Extract core mechanics from popular games and adapt to one-button control
- Reimagine classic arcade games with simplified inputs
- Convert complex game systems into timing-based challenges

### 5.2 Natural Phenomena & Physics
- Base mechanics on pendulums, waves, or gravity
- Use geometric principles like rotation, reflection, and symmetry
- Simulate simplified physics like magnetism or momentum

### 5.3 Creative Constraints
- Set extreme limitations (e.g., "maximum of 3 objects on screen")
- Remove conventional elements (e.g., no direct movement control)
- Combine seemingly incompatible mechanics

### 5.4 Risk-Reward Design
- Create tiered reward systems with corresponding risk levels
- Design mechanics where speed or score increases danger
- Implement meaningful choices between safe and risky strategies

### 5.5 SCAMPER Method Applied

| Method | Application to One-Button Games |
|--------|--------------------------------|
| **Substitute** | Replace jumping with teleportation |
| **Combine** | Merge bouncing mechanics with direction changes |
| **Adapt** | Turn table tennis concepts into a space setting |
| **Modify** | Character grows larger with button hold duration |
| **Put to other uses** | Convert enemies into tools the player can use |
| **Eliminate** | Remove expected elements like gravity |
| **Rearrange** | Create stages that constantly reconfigure |

## 6. Game Mechanics Classification

### 6.1 Player Movement Mechanics
- **Bounce**: Character constantly bounces; timing affects height/direction
- **Auto-Run**: Character moves automatically; button affects jumps/actions
- **Reflection**: Character bounces off walls with predictable angles
- **Gravity Shift**: Button inverts gravity direction
- **Teleportation**: Button instantly moves character to new positions

### 6.2 Action Mechanics
- **Area Effect**: Clear multiple enemies with precisely timed actions
- **Counter Timing**: Success depends on timing relative to enemy actions
- **Projectile Physics**: Shots follow realistic arcs affected by gravity
- **Chain Reactions**: Initial action triggers cascading events
- **State Toggling**: Switch between different character states/abilities

### 6.3 Environmental Mechanics
- **Platform Navigation**: Timed jumps between moving or temporary platforms
- **Hazard Avoidance**: Precise timing to avoid crushing, spiking elements
- **Physics Puzzles**: Use momentum and timing to navigate obstacles
- **Zone Effects**: Different areas change how the button functions
- **Resource Management**: Limited action uses that must be managed
